# Scant Yew Client


To start:

`trunk serve`

See the examples from the yewstack/yew repository  https://github.com/yewstack/yew

To run this will need the actual yew repo master branch in the relatively correct directory (see the cargo.toml, yew should be a sibling dir of this dir.)





# (Was...)

This started life as a splice of some Yew examples: One for todomvc, one part from webgl. I added in some previous work I'd done, and a lot will be added in the upcoming days.


Most recently (March 5), spliced in the websocket implementation from the dashboard example -- this is all the most recent master branch examples and framework.
